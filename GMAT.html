          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            GMAT is a registered trademark of the Graduate Management Admission
            Council.[7] More than 7,000 programs at approximately 2,300+
            graduate business schools around the world accept the GMAT as part
            of the selection criteria for their programs.[8] Business schools
            use the test as a criterion for admission into a wide range of
            graduate management programs, including MBA, Master of Accountancy,
            Master of Finance programs and others. The GMAT is administered in
            standardized test centers in 114 countries around the world.[5]
            According to a survey conducted by Kaplan Test Prep, the GMAT is
            still the number one choice for MBA aspirants despite the increasing
            acceptability of GRE scores.[9] According to GMAC, it has
            continually performed validity studies to statistically verify that
            the exam predicts success in business school programs.
          </p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            In 1953, the organization now called the Graduate Management
            Admission Council (GMAC) began as an association of nine business
            schools, whose goal was to develop a standardized test to help
            business schools select qualified applicants. In the first year it
            was offered, the assessment (now known as the Graduate Management
            Admission Test), was taken just over 2,000 times; in recent years,
            it has been taken more than 230,000 times annually.[11] Initially
            used in admissions by 54 schools, the test is now used by more than
            7,000 programs at approximately 2,300 graduate business schools
            around the world.[11] On June 5, 2012, GMAC introduced an integrated
            reasoning section to the exam that aims to measure a test taker's
            ability to evaluate information presented in multiple formats from
            multiple sources.
          </p>
          <h3>Criticism</h3>
          <p>
            The GMAT is intended to assess Verbal Reasoning skill, Quantitative
            Reasoning skill, Integrated Reasoning skill and Analytical Writing
            skill in English for use in admission to a graduate management
            program, such as an MBA program.[4] In 2013, an independent research
            study considered three full-time MBA programs and reported that the
            GMAT Total score had a 0.29 correlation with the first-year GPA
            (Grade Point Average) of the MBA programs while undergraduate GPA
            had a 0.35 correlation. When the GMAT Total score was combined with
            undergraduate GPA, the AACSB score[clarification needed] provided
            the best predictive power (0.45) for the first-year performance on
            MBA core courses.[13] Another independent research study from 2015
            reported that the GMAT Total score did not add predictive power
            after undergraduate GPA and work experience had been considered.[14]
            However, the data used in that paper was based on a single MBA
            program, and the methodology and results of the study were not
            verified. In 2017, GMAC conducted a large-scale validity study
            involving 28 graduate business programs, and the results showed that
            the median correlation between the GMAT Total score and graduate GPA
            was 0.38, the median correlation between the GMAT IR score and
            graduate GPA was 0.27, and the median correlation between
            undergraduate GPA and graduate GPA was 0.32. The results also showed
            that undergraduate GPA and GMAT scores (i.e., Verbal, Quant, IR, and
            AWA) jointly had 0.51 correlation with graduate GPA.[
          </p>
          <h3>Format and Timing</h3>
          <p>
            The GMAT exam consists of four sections: an analytical writing
            assessment, an integrated reasoning section, a quantitative section,
            and a verbal section.[16] Total testing time is three hours and
            seven minutes. Test takers have 30 minutes for the analytical
            writing assessment and another 30 minutes to work through 12
            questions, which often have multiple parts, on the integrated
            reasoning section and are given 62 minutes to work through 31
            questions in the quantitative section and another 65 minutes to get
            through 36 questions in the verbal section.

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <h3>Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA)</h3>
          <p>
            The AWA consists of a 30-minute writing taskâ€”analysis of an
            argument. It is important to be able to analyze the reasoning behind
            a given argument and write a critique of that argument. The essay
            will be given two independent ratings and these ratings are averaged
            together to determine the test taker's AWA score. One rating is
            given by a computerized reading evaluation and another is given by a
            person at GMAC who will read and score the essay themselves without
            knowing what the computerized score was. The automated essay-scoring
            engine is an electronic system that evaluates more than 50
            structural and linguistic features, including organization of ideas,
            syntactic variety, and topical analysis. If the two ratings differ
            by more than one point, another evaluation by an expert reader is
            required to resolve the discrepancy and determine the final score.
          </p>
          <h3>Integrated reasoning section</h3>
          <p>
            Integrated Reasoning (IR) is a section introduced in June 2012 and
            is designed to measure a test taker's ability to evaluate data
            presented in multiple formats from multiple sources. The skills
            being tested by the integrated reasoning section were identified in
            a survey of 740 management faculty worldwide as important for
            today's incoming students.[19] The integrated reasoning section
            consists of 12 questions (which often consist of multiple parts
            themselves) in four different formats: graphics interpretation,
            two-part analysis, table analysis, and multi-source reasoning.
            Integrated reasoning scores range from 1 to 8. Like the Analytical
            Writing Assessment (AWA), this section is scored separately from the
            quantitative and verbal section. Performance on the IR and AWA
            sections do not contribute to the total GMAT score. The integrated
            reasoning section includes four question types: table analysis,
            graphics interpretation, multi-source reasoning, and two-part
            analysis.[19] In the table analysis section, test takers are
            presented with a sortable table of information, similar to a
            spreadsheet, which has to be analyzed. Each question will have
            several statements with opposite-answer options (e.g., true/false,
            yes/no), and test takers click on the correct option. Graphics
            interpretation questions ask test takers to interpret a graph or
            graphical image. Each question has fill-in-the-blank statements with
            pull-down menus; test takers must choose the options that make the
            statements accurate. Multi-source reasoning questions are
            accompanied by two to three sources of information presented on
            tabbed pages. Test takers click on the tabs and examine all the
            relevant information, which may be a combination of text, charts,
            and tables to answer either traditional multiple-choice or
            opposite-answer (e.g., yes/no, true/false) questions. Two-part
            analysis questions involve two components for a solution. Possible
            answers are given in a table format with a column for each component
            and rows with possible options. Test takers have to choose one
            response per column.
          </p>
          <h3>Quantitative section</h3>
          <p>
            The quantitative section of the GMAT seeks to measure the ability to
            reason quantitatively, solve quantitative problems, interpret
            graphic data, and analyze and use information given in a problem.
            Questions require knowledge of certain algebra, geometry, and
            arithmetic. There are two types of quantitative questions: problem
            solving and data sufficiency. The use of calculators is not allowed
            on the quantitative section of the GMAT. Test takers must do their
            math work out by hand using a wet erase pen and laminated graph
            paper which are given to them at the testing center. Scores range
            from 0 to 60, although GMAC only reports scores between 6 and
            51.[20] Problem solving questions are designed to test the ability
            to reason quantitatively and to solve quantitative problems. Data
            sufficiency is a question type unique to the GMAT designed to
            measure the ability to understand and analyze a quantitative
            problem, recognize what information is relevant or irrelevant and
            determine at what point there is enough information to solve a
            problem or recognize the fact that there is insufficient information
            given to solve a particular problem.
          </p>
          <h3>Verbal section</h3>
          <p>
            The verbal section of the GMAT exam includes the following question
            types: reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and sentence
            correction. Each question type gives five answer options from which
            to select. Verbal scores range from 0 to 60; however, scores below 9
            or above 44 are rare.[21] According to GMAC, the reading
            comprehension question type tests ability to analyze information and
            draw a conclusion. Reading comprehension passages can be anywhere
            from one to several paragraphs long.[22] According to GMAC, the
            critical reasoning question type assesses reasoning skills.[21][23]
            According to GMAC, the sentence correction question type tests
            grammar and effective communication skills. From the available
            answer options, the test taker should select the most effective
            construction that best expresses the intent of the sentence.
          </p>
          <h3>Scoring</h3>
          <p>
            The total GMAT score ranges from 200 to 800 and measures performance
            on the quantitative and verbal sections together (performance on the
            AWA and IR sections do not count toward the total score, those
            sections are scored separately). Scores are given in increments of
            10 (e.g. 540, 550, 560, 570, etc.). The score distribution conforms
            to a bell curve with a standard deviation of approximately 120
            points, meaning that about 68% of examinees score between 430 and
            670.[21] More precisely, over the three-year period 2014â€“2017 the
            mean score was 556.04 with a standard deviation of 120.45
            points.[26] The final score is not based solely on the last question
            the examinee answers (i.e. the level of difficulty of questions
            reached through the computer adaptive presentation of questions).
            The algorithm used to build a score is more complicated than that.
            The examinee can make a mistake and answer incorrectly and the
            computer will recognize that item as an anomaly. If the examinee
            misses the first question, the final score will not necessarily fall
            in the bottom half of the range.
