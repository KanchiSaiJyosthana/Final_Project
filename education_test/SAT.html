          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The SAT is wholly owned, developed, and published by the College
            Board, a private, not-for-profit organization in the United States.
            It is administered on behalf of the College Board by the Educational
            Testing Service,[4] which until recently developed the SAT as
            well.[5] The test is intended to assess students' readiness for
            college. The SAT was originally designed not to be aligned with high
            school curricula,[6] but several adjustments were made for the
            version of the SAT introduced in 2016, and College Board president,
            David Coleman, has said that he also wanted to make the test reflect
            more closely what students learn in high school with the new Common
            Core standards.
          </p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            The SAT takes three hours to finish and as of 2021 costs US$55.00,
            excluding late fees, with additional processing fees if the SAT is
            taken outside the United States.[8] Scores on the SAT range from 400
            to 1600, combining test results from two 200-to-800-point sections:
            the Mathematics section and the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing
            section. Although taking the SAT, or its competitor the ACT, is
            required for freshman entry to many colleges and universities in the
            United States,[9] during the 2010s, many institutions made these
            entrance exams optional,[10][11][12] but this did not stop the
            students from attempting to achieve high scores[13] as they and
            their parents are skeptical of what "optional" means in this
            context.[14] In fact, the test-taking population was increasing
            steadily.[15] And while this may have resulted in a long-term
            decline in scores,[15][16][17] experts cautioned against using this
            to gauge the scholastic levels of the entire U.S. population.
          </p>
          <h3>Structure</h3>
          <p>
            The SAT two main sections, namely Evidence-Based Reading and Writing
            (EBRW, normally known as the "English" portion of the test) and the
            Math section. These are both further broken down into four sections:
            Reading, Writing and Language, Math (no calculator), and Math
            (calculator allowed). The test taker was also optionally able to
            write an essay which, in that case, is the fifth test section. The
            total time for the scored portion of the SAT is three hours (or
            three hours and fifty minutes if the optional essay section was
            taken). Some test takers who are not taking the essay may also have
            a fifth section, which is used, at least in part, for the pretesting
            of questions that may appear on future administrations of the SAT.
            (These questions are not included in the computation of the SAT
            score.) Two section scores result from taking the SAT:
            Evidence-Based Reading and Writing, and Math. Section scores are
            reported on a scale of 200 to 800, and each section score is a
            multiple of ten. A total score for the SAT is calculated by adding
            the two section scores, resulting in total scores that range from
            400 to 1600. In addition to the two section scores, three "test"
            scores on a scale of 10 to 40 are reported, one for each of Reading,
            Writing and Language, and Math, with increment of 1 for Reading /
            Writing and Language, and 0.5 for Math. There are also two
            cross-test scores that each range from 10 to 40 points: Analysis in
            History/Social Studies and Analysis in Science.[30] The essay, if
            taken, was scored separately from the two section scores.[31] Two
            people score each essay by each awarding 1 to 4 points in each of
            three categories: Reading, Analysis, and Writing.[32] These two
            scores from the different examiners are then combined to give a
            total score from 2 to 8 points per category. Though sometimes people
            quote their essay score out of 24, the College Board themselves do
            not combine the different categories to give one essay score,
            instead giving a score for each category.
          </p>
          <h3>Reading Test</h3>
          <p>
            The Reading Test of the SAT contains one section of 52 questions and
            a time limit of 65 minutes.[31] All questions are multiple-choice
            and based on reading passages. Tables, graphs, and charts may
            accompany some passages, but no math is required to correctly answer
            the corresponding questions. There are five passages (up to two of
            which may be a pair of smaller passages) on the Reading Test and
            10-11 questions per passage or passage pair. SAT Reading passages
            draw from three main fields: history, social studies, and science.
            Each SAT Reading Test always includes: one passage from U.S. or
            world literature; one passage from either a U.S. founding document
            or a related text; one passage about economics, psychology,
            sociology, or another social science; and, two science passages.
            Answers to all of the questions are based only on the content stated
            in or implied by the passage or passage pair.
          </p>
          <h3>Writing and Language Test</h3>
          <p>
            The Writing and Language Test of the SAT is made up of one section
            with 44 multiple-choice questions and a time limit of 35
            minutes.[31] As with the Reading Test, all questions are based on
            reading passages which may be accompanied by tables, graphs, and
            charts. The test taker will be asked to read the passages, suggest
            corrections or improvements for the contents underlined. Reading
            passages on this test range in content from topic arguments to
            nonfiction narratives in a variety of subjects. The skills being
            evaluated include: increasing the clarity of argument; improving
            word choice; improving analysis of topics in social studies and
            science; changing sentence or word structure to increase
            organizational quality and impact of writing; and, fixing or
            improving sentence structure, word usage, and punctuation.[34] The
            Writing and Language Test reports two subscores, each ranging from 1
            to 15 points
          </p>
          <h3>Mathematics</h3>
          <p>
            The mathematics portion of the SAT is divided into two sections:
            Math Test – No Calculator and Math Test – Calculator. In total, the
            SAT math test is 80 minutes long and includes 58 questions: 45
            multiple choice questions and 13 grid-in questions.[35] The multiple
            choice questions have four possible answers; the grid-in questions
            are free response and require the test taker to provide an answer.
            The Math Test – No Calculator section has 20 questions (15 multiple
            choice and 5 grid-in) and lasts 25 minutes. The Math Test –
            Calculator section has 38 questions (30 multiple choice and 8
            grid-in) and lasts 55 minutes. Several scores are provided to the
            test taker for the math test. A subscore (on a scale of 1 to 15) is
            reported for each of three categories of math content: "Heart of
            Algebra" (linear equations, systems of linear equations, and linear
            functions) "Problem Solving and Data Analysis" (statistics,
            modeling, and problem-solving skills) "Passport to Advanced Math"
            (non-linear expressions, radicals, exponentials and other topics
            that form the basis of more advanced math). A test score for the
            math test is reported on a scale of 10 to 40, with an increment of
            0.5, and a section score (equal to the test score multiplied by 20)
            is reported on a scale of 200 to 800.
          </p>
          <h3>Calculator use</h3>
          <p>
            All scientific and most graphing calculators, including Computer
            Algebra System (CAS) calculators, are permitted on the SAT Math –
            Calculator section only. All four-function calculators are allowed
            as well; however, these devices are not recommended. All mobile
            phone and smartphone calculators, calculators with typewriter-like
            (QWERTY) keyboards, laptops and other portable computers, and
            calculators capable of accessing the Internet are not permitted.[39]
            Research was conducted by the College Board to study the effect of
            calculator use on SAT I: Reasoning Test math scores. The study found
            that performance on the math section was associated with the extent
            of calculator use: those using calculators on about one third to one
            half of the items averaged higher scores than those using
            calculators more or less frequently. However, the effect was "more
            likely to have been the result of able students using calculators
            differently than less able students rather than calculator use per
            se."[40] There is some evidence that the frequent use of a
            calculator in school outside of the testing situation has a positive
            effect on test performance compared to those who do not use
            calculators in school.
          </p>
          <h3>Style of questions</h3>
          <p>
            Most of the questions on the SAT, except for the optional essay and
            the grid-in math responses, are multiple choice; all multiple-choice
            questions have four answer choices, one of which is correct.
            Thirteen of the questions on the math portion of the SAT (about 22%
            of all the math questions) are not multiple choice.[42] They instead
            require the test taker to bubble in a number in a four-column grid.
            All questions on each section of the SAT are weighted equally. For
            each correct answer, one raw point is added.[43] No points are
            deducted for incorrect answers. The final score is derived from the
            raw score; the precise conversion chart varies between test
            administrations.
          </p>
          <h3>SAT–ACT score comparisons</h3>
          <p>
            The College Board and ACT, Inc., conducted a joint study of students
            who took both the SAT and the ACT between September 2004 (for the
            ACT) or March 2005 (for the SAT) and June 2006. Tables were provided
            to concord scores for students taking the SAT after January 2005 and
            before March 2016.[53][54] In May 2016, the College Board released
            concordance tables to concord scores on the SAT used from March 2005
            through January 2016 to the SAT used since March 2016, as well as
            tables to concord scores on the SAT used since March 2016 to the
            ACT.[55] In 2018, the College Board, in partnership with the ACT,
            introduced a new concordance table to better compare how a student
            would fare one test to another.[56] This is now considered the
            official concordance to be used by college professionals and is
            replacing the one from 2016. The new concordance no longer features
            the old SAT (out of 2,400), just the new SAT (out of 1,600) and the
            ACT (out of 36).
