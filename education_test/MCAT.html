                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is a computer-based standardized examination for
                    prospective medical students in the United States, Australia,[9] Canada, and Caribbean Islands. It
                    is designed to assess problem solving, critical thinking, written analysis and knowledge of
                    scientific concepts and principles. Before 2007, the exam was a paper-and-pencil test; since 2007,
                    all administrations of the exam have been computer-based.

                    The most recent version of the exam was introduced in April 2015 and takes 7.5 hours to complete.
                    The test is scored in a range from 472 to 528. The MCAT is administered by the Association of
                    American Medical Colleges (AAMC).[
                </p>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <h4>Moss Test: 1928–46</h4>
                <p>
                    In the 1920s, dropout rates in US medical schools soared from 5% to 50%,[11] leading to the
                    development of a test that would measure readiness for medical school. Physician F. A. Moss and his
                    colleagues developed the "Scholastic Aptitude Test for Medical Students" consisting of true-false
                    and multiple choice questions divided into six to eight subtests. Topics tested included visual
                    memory, memory for content, scientific vocabulary, scientific definitions, understanding of printed
                    material, premedical information, and logical reasoning. The score scale varied from different test
                    forms. Though it had been criticized at the time for testing only memorization ability and thus only
                    readiness for the first two years of medical school, later scholars[who?] denied this. In addition
                    to stricter medical school admission procedures and higher educational standards, the national
                    dropout rate among freshman medical students decreased from 20% in 1925–1930 to 7% in 1946.
                </p>
                <h4>A simpler test: 1946–62</h4>
                <p>
                    Advancements in test measurement technology, including machine scoring of tests, and changed views
                    regarding test scores and medical school readiness reflected the evolution of the test in this
                    period. The test underwent three major changes. It now had only four sub tests, including verbal
                    ability, quantitative ability, science achievement, and understanding modern society. Questions were
                    all in multiple-choice format. Each subtest was given a single score, and the total score was
                    derived from the sum of the scores from the subtests. The total score ranged from 200–800. The
                    individual scores helped medical school admission committees to differentiate the individual
                    abilities among their candidates. Admission committees, however, did not consider the "understanding
                    modern society" section to be of great importance, even though it was created to reward those with
                    broad liberal arts skills, which included knowledge of history, government, economics, and
                    sociology. Committees placed greater emphasis on scores on the scientific achievement section as it
                    was a better predictor of performance in medical school.
                </p>
                <h3>Administration</h3>
                <p>The exam is offered 25 or more times per year at Pearson VUE centers.[21] The number of
                    administrations may vary each year. 43% of students take the MCAT within one year of graduation, 44%
                    take the exam between one and four years after graduation and 13% sit for the exam five or more
                    years after graduation.[22]

                    The test, updated in 2015, consists of four sections, listed in the order that they are administered
                <ul>
                    <li>Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems</li>
                    <li>Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills (CARS)</li>
                    <li>Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems</li>
                    <li>Psychological, Social and Biological Foundations of Behavior</li>
                </ul>
                The four sections are in multiple-choice format. The passages and questions are predetermined, and
                thus do not change in difficulty depending on the performance of the test taker (unlike, for
                example, the general Graduate Record Examinations). </p>
                <h3>Test structure</h3>
                <p>The current MCAT consists of four distinct sections that are individually scored. Each section is
                    allotted either 90 or 95 minutes and tests between 50 and 60 questions. Including breaks, the full
                    examination lasts approximately 7.5 hours.[23] The information for each of the science sections is
                    organized into 10 foundational concepts and four Scientific Inquiry & Reasoning Skills.[24] The
                    science passages are guided by Scientific Reasoning and Inquiry Skills identified by the MR5 for
                    medical school success.[20] The Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills section focuses on three
                    skills, since this section does not require outside knowledge to answer questions.</p>
                <h3>Policies</h3>
                <p>Like some other professional exams (e.g. the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) or the Law
                    School Admissions Test (LSAT)), the MCAT may be voided on the day of the exam if the exam taker is
                    not satisfied with his or her performance. It can be voided at any time during the exam, or during a
                    five-minute window that begins immediately after the end of the last section. The decision to void
                    can only be based on the test taker's self-assessment, as no scoring information is available at the
                    time.

                    The AAMC prohibits the use of calculators, timers, or other electronic devices during the MCAT
                    exam.[31] Cellular phones are also strictly prohibited from testing rooms and individuals found to
                    possess them are noted by name in a security report submitted to the AAMC. The only item that may be
                    brought into the testing room is the candidate's photo ID. If a jacket or sweater is worn, it may
                    not be removed in the testing room.[32]

                    It is no longer a rule that students must receive permission from the AAMC if they wish to take the
                    MCAT more than three times in total. The limit with the computerized MCAT is three times per year,
                    with a lifetime limit of seven times.[33] An examinee can register for only one test date at a time,
                    and must wait two days after testing before registering for a new test date.

                    Scaled MCAT exam results are made available to examinees approximately thirty days after the test
                    via the AAMC's MCAT Testing History (THx) Web application. Examinees do not receive a copy of their
                    scores in the mail. Nor are examinees given their raw scores. MCAT THx is also used to transmit
                    scores to medical schools, application services and other organizations (at no cost). </p>
                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <p>The average student spent 12 weeks preparing for the MCAT exam spending about 23 hours per week,
                    excluding time taking regular courses.[22] Some students, however, choose to take more time.

                    On the weeks leading up to the exam, most students take some time off to study intensely for the
                    exam. The AAMC provides official study materials for purchase on their website with hundreds of
                    questions written by the developers of the MCAT including four scored practice exams and one
                    non-scored practice exam.[34] 74% of students who sat for the MCAT exam used official MCAT Practice
                    exams while only about 40% used question packs and section bank questions written by the AAMC. The
                    official questions supplied online by the AAMC were rated to be most useful by test takers.[22] The
                    AAMC also provides free online preparatory material for the MCAT through Khan Academy, including
                    1,100 free videos and 3,000 review questions including content review and passage-based questions.
                    About 62% of test takers used these free resources and 83% of them found them to be useful.[22]

                    Another popular study option for students is to use MCAT preparatory materials from a commercial
                    company. Many companies provide preparatory classes in-person and online, sets of preparatory books,
                    full-length practice exams, flashcards and many more. 77% of students used commercial preparation
                    books and 67% of students used practice exams published by a commercial company.[22] 85% of test
                    takers found MCAT prep books to be useful. </p>
