          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) is a standardized test that
            is an admissions requirement for many graduate schools[7] in the
            United States and Canada[8] and few in other countries. The GRE is
            owned and administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS).[9] The
            test was established in 1936 by the Carnegie Foundation for the
            Advancement of Teaching.[10]
          </p>
          <p>
            According to ETS, the GRE aims to measure verbal reasoning,
            quantitative reasoning, analytical writing, and critical thinking
            skills that have been acquired over a long period of learning. The
            content of the GRE consists of certain specific algebra, geometry,
            arithmetic, and vocabulary sections. The GRE General Test is offered
            as a computer-based exam administered at testing centers and
            institution owned or authorized by Prometric. In the graduate school
            admissions process, the level of emphasis that is placed upon GRE
            scores varies widely between schools and departments within schools.
            The importance of a GRE score can range from being a mere admission
            formality to an important selection factor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The GRE was significantly overhauled in August 2011, resulting in an
            exam that is not adaptive on a question-by-question basis, but
            rather by section, so that the performance on the first verbal and
            math sections determines the difficulty of the second sections
            presented. Overall, the test retained the sections and many of the
            question types from its predecessor, but the scoring scale was
            changed to a 130 to 170 scale (from a 200 to 800 scale).
          </p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            In 2006, ETS announced plans to make significant changes in the
            format of the GRE. Planned changes for the revised GRE included a
            longer testing time, a departure from computer-adaptive testing, a
            new grading scale, and an enhanced focus on reasoning skills and
            critical thinking for both the quantitative and qualitative
            sections.[17] On April 2, 2007, ETS announced the decision to cancel
            plans for revising the GRE.[18] The announcement cited concerns over
            the ability to provide clear and equal access to the new test after
            the planned changes as an explanation for the cancellation. The ETS
            stated, however, that they do plan "to implement many of the planned
            test content improvements in the future", although specific details
            regarding those changes were not initially announced. Changes to the
            GRE took effect on November 1, 2007, as ETS started to include new
            types of questions in the exam. The changes mostly centered on "fill
            in the blank" type answers for the mathematics section that requires
            the test-taker to fill in the blank directly, without being able to
            choose from a multiple choice list of answers. ETS announced plans
            to introduce two of these new types of questions in each
            quantitative section, while the majority of questions would be
            presented in the regular format.[19] Since January 2008, the Reading
            Comprehension within the verbal sections has been reformatted,
            passages' "line numbers will be replaced with highlighting when
            necessary in order to focus the test taker on specific information
            in the passage" to "help students more easily find the pertinent
            information in reading passages."[20] In December 2009, ETS
            announced plans to move forward with significant revisions to the
            GRE in 2011.[21] Changes include a new 130–170 scoring scale, the
            elimination of certain question types such as antonyms and
            analogies, the addition of an online calculator, and the elimination
            of the CAT format of question-by-question adjustment, in favor of a
            section by section adjustment.[22] On August 1, 2011, the Revised
            GRE General test replaced General GRE test. The revised GRE is said
            to be better by design and provides a better test taking experience.
            The new types of questions in the revised format are intended to
            test the skills needed in graduate and business schools
            programs.[23] From July 2012 onwards GRE announced an option for
            users to customize their scores called ScoreSelect.[24]
          </p>
          <h3>Structure</h3>
          <p>
            The computer-based GRE General Test consists of six sections. The
            first section is always the analytical writing section involving
            separately timed issue and argument tasks. The next five sections
            consist of two verbal reasoning sections, two quantitative reasoning
            sections, and either an experimental or research section. These five
            sections may occur in any order. The experimental section does not
            count towards the final score but is not distinguished from the
            scored sections. Unlike the computer adaptive test before August
            2011, the GRE General Test is a multistage test, where the
            examinee's performance on earlier sections determines the difficulty
            of subsequent sections. This format allows the examined person to
            freely move back and forth between questions within each section,
            and the testing software allows the user to "mark" questions within
            each section for later review if time remains. The entire testing
            procedure lasts about 3 hours 45 minutes.[25][26] One-minute breaks
            are offered after each section and a 10-minute break after the third
            section.
          </p>
          <h3>Verbal Section</h3>
          <p>
            The computer-based verbal sections assess reading comprehension,
            critical reasoning, and vocabulary usage. The verbal test is scored
            on a scale of 130–170, in 1-point increments. (Before August 2011,
            the scale was 200–800, in 10-point increments.) In a typical
            examination, each verbal section consists of 20 questions to be
            completed in 30 minutes.[25] Each verbal section consists of about 6
            text completion, 4 sentence equivalence, and 10 critical reading
            questions. The changes in 2011 include a reduced emphasis on rote
            vocabulary knowledge and the elimination of antonyms and analogies.
            Text completion items have replaced sentence completions and new
            reading question types allowing for the selection of multiple
            answers were added.
          </p>
          <h3>Quantitative section</h3>
          <p>
            The computer-based quantitative sections assess basic high school
            level mathematical knowledge and reasoning skills. The quantitative
            test is scored on a scale of 130–170, in 1-point increments (Before
            August 2011 the scale was 200–800, in 10-point increments). In a
            typical examination, each quantitative section consists of 20
            questions to be completed in 35 minutes.[25] Each quantitative
            section consists of about 8 quantitative comparisons, 9 problem
            solving items, and 3 data interpretation questions. The changes in
            2011 include the addition of numeric entry items requiring the
            examinee to fill in the blank and multiple-choice items requiring
            the examinee to select multiple correct responses.
          </p>
          <h3>Analytical writing section</h3>
          <p>
            The analytical writing section consists of two different essays, an
            "issue task" and an "argument task". The writing section is graded
            on a scale of 0–6, in half-point increments. The essays are written
            on a computer using a word processing program specifically designed
            by ETS. The program allows only basic computer functions and does
            not contain a spell-checker or other advanced features. Each essay
            is scored by at least two readers on a six-point holist scale. If
            the two scores are within one point, the average of the scores is
            taken. If the two scores differ by more than a point, a third reader
            examines the response.
          </p>
          <h3>Issue Task</h3>
          <p>
            The test taker is given 30 minutes to write an essay about a
            selected topic.[28] Issue topics are selected from a pool of
            questions, which the GRE Program has published in its entirety.
            Individuals preparing for the GRE may access the pool of tasks on
            the ETS website.
          </p>
          <h3>Argument Task</h3>
          <p>
            The test taker will be given an argument (i.e. a series of facts and
            considerations leading to a conclusion) and asked to write an essay
            that critiques the argument. Test takers are asked to consider the
            argument's logic and to make suggestions about how to improve the
            logic of the argument. Test takers are expected to address the
            logical flaws of the argument and not provide a personal opinion on
            the subject. The time allotted for this essay is 30 minutes.[25] The
            Arguments are selected from a pool of topics, which the GRE Program
            has published in its entirety. Individuals preparing for the GRE may
            access the pool of tasks on the ETS website.
          </p>
          <h3>Experimental section</h3>
          <p>
            The experimental section, which can be either verbal or
            quantitative, contains new questions ETS is considering for future
            use. Although the experimental section does not count towards the
            test-taker's score, it is unidentified and appears identical to the
            scored sections. Because test takers have no definite way of knowing
            which section is experimental, it is typically advised that test
            takers try their best and be focused on every section. Sometimes an
            identified research section at the end of the test is given instead
            of the experimental section.[31] There is no experimental section on
            the paper-based GRE.
