          <h1>GRE</h1>
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            The Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) is a standardized test that
            is an admissions requirement for many graduate schools[7] in the
            United States and Canada[8] and few in other countries. The GRE is
            owned and administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS).[9] The
            test was established in 1936 by the Carnegie Foundation for the
            Advancement of Teaching.[10]
          </p>
          <p>
            According to ETS, the GRE aims to measure verbal reasoning,
            quantitative reasoning, analytical writing, and critical thinking
            skills that have been acquired over a long period of learning. The
            content of the GRE consists of certain specific algebra, geometry,
            arithmetic, and vocabulary sections. The GRE General Test is offered
            as a computer-based exam administered at testing centers and
            institution owned or authorized by Prometric. In the graduate school
            admissions process, the level of emphasis that is placed upon GRE
            scores varies widely between schools and departments within schools.
            The importance of a GRE score can range from being a mere admission
            formality to an important selection factor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The GRE was significantly overhauled in August 2011, resulting in an
            exam that is not adaptive on a question-by-question basis, but
            rather by section, so that the performance on the first verbal and
            math sections determines the difficulty of the second sections
            presented. Overall, the test retained the sections and many of the
            question types from its predecessor, but the scoring scale was
            changed to a 130 to 170 scale (from a 200 to 800 scale).

          <h1>TOEFL</h1>
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL /ˈtoʊfəl/ TOH-fəl) is a
            standardized test to measure the English language ability of
            non-native speakers wishing to enroll in English-speaking
            universities. The test is accepted by more than 11,000 universities
            and other institutions in over 150 countries. TOEFL is one of the
            two major English-language tests in the world, the other being the
            IELTS.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1962, a national council made up of representatives of thirty
            government and private organizations was formed to address the
            problem of ensuring English language proficiency for non-native
            speakers wishing to study at U.S. universities. This council
            recommended the development and administration of the TOEFL exam for
            the 1963-1965 timings .[7] The test was originally developed at the
            Center for Applied Linguistics under the direction of Stanford
            University applied linguistics professor Dr. Charles A. Ferguson.[8]
            The TOEFL test was first administered in 1964 by the Modern Language
            Association financed by grants from the Ford Foundation and Danforth
            Foundation.[7] In 1965, The College Board and ETS jointly assumed
            responsibility for the continuation of the TOEFL testing program.[

          <p>
            The Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT (/ˈdʒiːmæt/ (JEE-mat)))
            is a computer adaptive test (CAT) intended to assess certain
            analytical, writing, quantitative, verbal, and reading skills in
            written English for use in admission to a graduate management
            program, such as an MBA program.[4] It requires knowledge of certain
            specific grammar and knowledge of certain specific algebra,
            geometry, and arithmetic. According to the test-owning company, the
            Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), the GMAT assesses
            analytical writing and problem-solving abilities while also
            addressing data sufficiency, logic, and critical reasoning skills
            that it believes to be vital to real-world business and management
            success.[5] It can be taken up to five times a year but no more than
            eight times total. Attempts must be at least 16 days apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            GMAT is a registered trademark of the Graduate Management Admission
            Council.[7] More than 7,000 programs at approximately 2,300+
            graduate business schools around the world accept the GMAT as part
            of the selection criteria for their programs.[8] Business schools
            use the test as a criterion for admission into a wide range of
            graduate management programs, including MBA, Master of Accountancy,
            Master of Finance programs and others. The GMAT is administered in
            standardized test centers in 114 countries around the world.[5]
            According to a survey conducted by Kaplan Test Prep, the GMAT is
            still the number one choice for MBA aspirants despite the increasing
            acceptability of GRE scores.[9] According to GMAC, it has
            continually performed validity studies to statistically verify that
            the exam predicts success in business school programs.

          <p>
            The SAT (/ˌɛsˌeɪˈtiː/ ess-ay-TEE) is a standardized test widely used
            for college admissions in the United States. Since its debut in
            1926, its name and scoring have changed several times; originally
            called the Scholastic Aptitude Test, it was later called the
            Scholastic Assessment Test, then the SAT I: Reasoning Test, then the
            SAT Reasoning Test, then simply the SAT.
          </p>
          <p>
            The SAT is wholly owned, developed, and published by the College
            Board, a private, not-for-profit organization in the United States.
            It is administered on behalf of the College Board by the Educational
            Testing Service,[4] which until recently developed the SAT as
            well.[5] The test is intended to assess students' readiness for
            college. The SAT was originally designed not to be aligned with high
            school curricula,[6] but several adjustments were made for the
            version of the SAT introduced in 2016, and College Board president,
            David Coleman, has said that he also wanted to make the test reflect
            more closely what students learn in high school with the new Common
            Core standards.

          <p>
            The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is a computer-based
            standardized examination for prospective medical students in the
            United States, Australia,[9] Canada, and Caribbean Islands. It is
            designed to assess problem solving, critical thinking, written
            analysis and knowledge of scientific concepts and principles. Before
            2007, the exam was a paper-and-pencil test; since 2007, all
            administrations of the exam have been computer-based.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most recent version of the exam was introduced in April 2015 and
            takes 7.5 hours to complete. The test is scored in a range from 472
            to 528. The MCAT is administered by the Association of American
            Medical Colleges (AAMC).
